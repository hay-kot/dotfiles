# Project Draft

Create a new project note and initial work items in the Obsidian vault.

## Vault Resolution

The vault root is stored in `$OBSIDIAN_NOTEBOOK_DIR`. Always resolve before writing:

```bash
echo "$OBSIDIAN_NOTEBOOK_DIR"
```

If the variable is empty, stop and tell the user to set `OBSIDIAN_NOTEBOOK_DIR`.

## Interview

Ask the user for the following before writing anything:

1. **Project name** — used as the folder and note title (title case, spaces OK)
2. **Goal** — one or two sentences describing what success looks like
3. **Repos** — which repositories are involved (if any)
4. **Initial work items** — the first concrete things to work on
   - For each item: name, objective, starting phase, priority

Phases: `ideation | research | design | planning | in-progress | review | done`
Priorities: `high | medium | low`

## File Structure

```
$OBSIDIAN_NOTEBOOK_DIR/Projects/<Project Name>/
├── <Project Name>.md         ← project note
└── Work Items/
    └── <Work Item Name>.md   ← one file per work item
```

Create directories before writing:

```bash
mkdir -p "$OBSIDIAN_NOTEBOOK_DIR/Projects/<Project Name>/Work Items"
```

## Dates

Use today's date for all `created` fields:

```

## After Writing

1. List all files created with their full paths
2. Tell the user they can run `/project-advance` to start progressing any work item
3. Remind them to open `Projects/index.base` in Obsidian for the full dashboard
