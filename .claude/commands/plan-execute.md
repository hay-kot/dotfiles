Read PLAN.local.md to understand your task Ensure you're on a feature branch; create one if needed For each plan step:

- Mark step as "IN PROGRESS" in the plan
- Implement the necessary changes
- Run appropriate tests/linting
- Commit changes with descriptive messages
- Mark step as "COMPLETED" in the plan
- Document any deviations or blockers encountered
- Make small, focused commits rather than large changes
- Run final verification after completing all steps

The plan is a guide - if you find a better approach during implementation, document your reasoning and proceed with the improved solution.
